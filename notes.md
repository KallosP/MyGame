# Notes
- OpenGL = open graphics library
- glfw = graphics library framework 
    - built on top of OpenGL
    - creates windows with OpenGL context, sets up callbacks, and handles timing/monitors for you
- rasturizer interpolates all attributes: position, color, etc (draws the line between points)
- shader module = a part of the shader program
- **most objects in OpenGL are written as unsigned integers**
- points on the screen
  - follow the format x, y, z, r, g, b
  - y-axis: 
    - 0 = center of screen
    - 1 = top of screen
    - -1 = bottom of screen
  - x-axis:
    - 0 = center of screen
    - 1 = right of screen
    - -1 = left of screen
  - NOTE: This method of putting points on the screen is known as **NDC = normalized device coordinates**
- In OpenGL, **attribute = a set of 1 to 4 numbers describing something (e.g. x,y,z define position; r,g,b define color)**
- In OpenGL, **vertex = a collection of attributes needed to draw a point (e.g. x,y,z,r,g,b all together are a vertex)**
- buffer = a big list of data
- interleaving (i.e. tightly linked) attributes is best for performance 
    - sometimes that isn't possible (e.g. w/ heterogenous data), so they must be separated into their own data structures
- hetergenous data = data w/ different data types
- homogenous data = data w/ the same data type
- the txt files that have what looks like C/C++ code are GLSL (OpenGL shading language)
