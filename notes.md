# Notes
- OpenGL = open graphics library
- glfw = graphics library framework 
    - built on top of OpenGL
    - creates windows with OpenGL context, sets up callbacks, and handles timing/monitors for you
- rasturizer interpolates all attributes: position, color, etc (draws the line between points)
- shader module = a part of the shader program
- **most objects in OpenGL are written as unsigned integers**
